  The following problems need solving:

  1) Closing down the server

     How do I kill and window and close down the connection in an
     orderly manner.

  2) Keyboard mapping is hard coded  - I need code to get the key and sym
     tables from the server and then apply them dynamically

  3) How do I communicate with the window manager?

  4) We to write lots more widgets and "mega widgets"

  5) How about some proper "look and feel" - My 3D shading of
     buttons is very primitive

  6) Support for more fonts.

     * is hard coded in almost everywhere

  7) Support for varaible width fonts

  8) Make a visual erlang - see the demo code

   If you feel you can make progress on any of these problems please contact
me or mail the Erlang list.
